This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  Sometimes, the dimensions are initially zero or incorrect, leading to layout issues or crashes.

```javascript
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

console.log('Width:', width); // Might be 0 initially
console.log('Height:', height);
```
